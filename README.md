## Lesson Plan 

## Extend Your Learning

* To see the guy whose materials explain this check out his video on [Bayes without Counting]()  
* Materials for this lecture are mostly derived from [this fantastic textbook]() by [Richard McElreath]. If you are interested in this, please sooth yourself with more than 20 hours of free lectures on YouTube of him talking about this.
* This book by John Krutsche also is great (but a slow burn)
* For those wanting to dive deeper on the whole philosophy of science that lurks in the background of all of this, check out [this book] or for you academic nerds [this one].
